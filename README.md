Purpose
-------
This is a simple application to perform linear regression. The application can read the input data from a .txt file, and then either perform the regression using the normal equations method, or the gradient descent method. The application also gives the user the option to generate their own test data.


Build Instructions
------------------

The project can be built using the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/SeanBrayUCL/PHAS0100Assignment1  (note: this repository is private, but command would work if public)
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Command Line Interface 
----------------------

The application has a command line interface which the user can access from within the build folder after running the make command using the following command:

```
cd bin
./lrgLinearRegression  (add arugments)
```
If the above is run without any arugments, instructions outlining how the command line tool should be used will be outputted.

To run the application the user needs to provide two commands summarised below:
```
-d or --data MAKE/Address of text file
-s or --solver NE/GD 
```
The --data option is where the user specifies the data to be used. Inputting --data MAKE will create data for the user to use, while --data followed by the address of the text file with the input data will read the text file and the data in the file.

The --solver option is where the user specifies whether to use the Normal Equations method or the Gradient Descent method to perform the regression. Inputting --solver NE will use the Normal Equations, while --solver GD will use gradient descent.

Miscellaneous 
----------------------
The default setting for the data generated by the -d MAKE command is to generate 1000 pairs of an explanatory and dependent variables with an intercept of 2 and slope of 1. These paramters can be updated by going to the script Assignment1/Code/CommandLine/Apps/lrgLinearRegression.cpp . On line 61 of this script the user will see 

```
LinearDataCreator data(2,1,1000);
```
where 2 refers to the slope, 1 the intercept and 1000 the number of pairs created. These paramters can be updated for the command line tool, by updating the above expression and making the application again.


The default setting for the gradient descent solver invoked by -s GD command is an inital slope of 2, an intial intercept of 1, a learning rate of 0.01, and 1000 iteratons of the algorithm. These paramters can be updated by going to the script Assignment1/Code/CommandLine/Apps/lrgLinearRegression.cpp . On line 36 of this script the user will see 

```
GradientDescentSolverStrategy GD(1,2,0.01,1000);
```
where 1 refers to the slope, 2 the intercept, 0.01 the learning rate and 1000 the number of iterations of the algoritm. These paramters can be updated for the command line tool, by updating the above expression and making the application again.
